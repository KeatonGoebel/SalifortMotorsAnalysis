# SalifortMotorsAnalysis
This project was the final assignment I completed in order to obtain my Google Advaced Data Analytics certification through Coursera. In this scenario, I was working for a fictional company, Salifort Motors. They had been having a problem with a high turnover rate and they wanted me to investigate the possible causes why. This assignment involved drafting a project proposal, conducting the data analysis, and drafting a one-page summary of my results. 

## Project Proposal
This proposal involved braking the most significant steps of my data analysis into milestones so that I could present them to other people before I started working. Each milestone was also assigned to part of the PACE framework. PACE is an acronym where each letter represents a different stage in the project: plan, analyze, construct, and execute. Understanding the scope of the problem, research, and aquiring data are examples of the planning stage. Data exploration, data cleaning, and evaluating model results would be examples of the analsis stage. Constructing the model and adjusting the model as you evaluate its results are examples of the constructing stage. Finally, intrpreting model results and sharing results are examples of the execute stage.   

## Data Analysis
The Data Analysis started by gathering basic information about the dataset using the .info() and the .describe() functions. These functions told me some important information like the datatypes of the columns I was working with and statistic information like the mean, min, and max of each column. Next, I conducted some data cleaning. I renamed my columns to standardize lower case, snake casing, and made the names of columns more concise. I also checked if I need to remove any missing columns or duplicate columns. The next stage of my analysis was creating a series of data visualizations to better examine the data I was interested in. These visualizations often revealed that the employees who left had worked a very large number of hours, taken on a large number of projects, or been at the company for many years without a promotion.
